# ECGenius 🫀

> An AI-powered ECG analysis web application for automated arrhythmia detection and cardiac signal classification.


---

## Overview

ECGenius is a deep learning–powered web application that analyzes electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to detect and classify cardiac arrhythmias. Built with PyTorch and Flask, it provides clinicians and researchers with an intuitive interface for uploading ECG data and receiving instant AI-driven diagnostic insights.

The project combines state-of-the-art signal processing libraries with a modern web frontend to bridge the gap between raw ECG data and interpretable cardiac analysis.

## Features

- **Automated Arrhythmia Detection** — Deep learning model trained to classify multiple cardiac conditions from raw ECG signals
- **Signal Preprocessing** — Noise filtering, baseline wander removal, and R-peak detection powered by NeuroKit2 and BioSPPy
- **WFDB Format Support** — Compatible with PhysioNet/WFDB standard ECG file formats
- **Interactive Visualizations** — Plotly-powered charts for ECG waveform rendering and analysis results
- **REST API** — Flask backend exposing clean endpoints for ECG ingestion and prediction
- **Deployed on Vercel** — Serverless deployment for low-latency inference
